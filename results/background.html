  <h3>Background</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Blood plasma proteins are modifiable and have been associated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) but determining causality is challenging.</li>
    <li>Proteomics now enables genetic overlap analysis of blood plasma proteins and AD with Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) and combined with Mendelian Randomization (MR) can help determine protein causality.</li>  
    <li>This study aims to identify if there are significant associations between blood plasma protein polygenic risk scores (PRS) and AD and, for associated proteins, identify whether exposure to the protein is causal using MR.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Analysis structure</h3>
  
  
  <p> The analysis is structured around 4 main steps </p>
